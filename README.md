# DayZ Map Mods

Thank you for downloading ANY of my custom map edits for DayZ on console!

The files contained within include all of my custom map edits for Chernarus+.  I put an extremely large ammount of both work and time on every file within this project and am happy to share each and every one with you guys!  Please note, I do offer a service on my website for custom map projects.  Those paid projects will NOT be shared here out of respect for the customer and the agreement set forth on my website.  If you are interested in a custom map edit, please check out my website https://www.kyronomix.com !

# Installation

Download this zip archive.

Stop your Nitrado Server.

Replace the Events.xml and Cfgeventspawns.xml file inside your Nitrado Server directory.

Now you now start the server again.

Wait about 30 minutes, this is so all of the building can spawn.  Sometimes it does not take that long, sometimes it will take longer.  Be patient :)

Join your server and enjoy the map!
